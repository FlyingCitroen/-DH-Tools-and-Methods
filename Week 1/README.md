### Topic: Cultural Analysis of Cross-Language Twitter Users' Emotional Evaluations of Harry Potter Characters
Sentiment Analysis is an important area now, and Harry Potter, as a global literature, reading by people in every age group all over the world.
Neethu and Rajasree(2013) do some research in analysis twitter by machine learning techniques, which will be very helpful for this topic.
Jacobs(2019) also do some research about the sentiment in Harry Potter, but what he did is about analysis text in books.
The most instructive is Walsh's (2021) sentiment analysis of Trump's tweets. This was not only the inspiration for me to come up with this topic, but also the key that opened the door to sentiment analysis for me.

### Research Questions:
1. What is the variability in the emotional evaluation of Harry Potter characters by Twitter users in different languages?
2. What are the points of resonance and divergence?

### Methods
1. Confirmation of the scope of data collection. Some representative districts, and cultural groups known to the researcher. The problem is language.
2. Collecting data from Twitter with different key words. For example, Hermione, Ron, or Granger, Weasley, etc. However, for characters with the same family name, need to seperate them.
3. Sentiment analysis of this data using natural language processing in Python. Distinguish between positive and negative comments about different characters and score them according to wording.
4. Conduct comparative analysis. Possible scenario: a character is particularly popular in one group and negative in others. Differences in high and low scores among characters that are also negative/positive.

### Data Type
1. Twitter Data:
   The tweets with key words in different languages.
2. Meta Data Attributes:
   Attributes about the users. Language, age, number of following and followers.
   Time of they posted these tweets.
3. Sentiment Scores:
   Using tools to generate the sentiment score of each tweet.
4. Cultural Background:
   Seperate the users into different groups.
5. Other Data:
   For example something not related to natural language such as emoji and pictures.

### Tools
1. Using nltk to analysis sentiment.
2. Using Seaborn to generate graphs.
3. Translate tools or some thing helpful in cross-culture studies.
